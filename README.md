lein-fregec
===========

A Leiningen plugin to compile Frege code.

Very much a work-in-progress right now.

It's currently hardcoded to compile Hi.fr into cljbuild/Hi.java.

I'm working on supporting Frege compiler options right now but just wanted this in a shared location so I can work on it from multiple machines!
