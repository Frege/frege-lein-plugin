lein-fregec
===========

A Leiningen plugin to compile Frege code.

Very much a work-in-progress right now.

It compiles Frege source (in :frege-source-path or ".") to :compile-path, but only compiles .fr to .java right now.

I'm working on supporting Frege compiler options right now but just wanted this in a shared location so I can work on it from multiple machines!
